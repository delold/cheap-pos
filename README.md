# cheap-pos
POS written from scratch. Targetted for Raspberry PI. 

This project is mainly for encouraging other DIY solutions. Also, as an open-source implementation of the future state-based record tracking (oh god...)

# run the server
```
npm install
npm start
```

# run python client
Python 3.4+ with Tk/Ttk support required.
```
python ./python/client.py
```

# browser client
*TODO:* needs to be integrated with the server (implement WS?)
